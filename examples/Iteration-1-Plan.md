## Goal
A workable web app that displays poll questions and allows visitors to select a poll question from a list of responses. The application displays the correct number of "votes" for each choice in the selected poll question. The results are retained even if the application is restarted.

## Features
1. Display a list of the most recent poll questions.
2. Each poll question is linked to a page that displays the question and a list of choices.
3. Visitor can choose a poll question and vote on it. His/her vote is counted toward the total.
4. Visitor can see the total votes for each choice on a poll question after voting.
5. Every poll has a publication date (start date) and is only visible on or after that date.
6. The poll questions and responses are saved in a database.
7. The administrator has the ability to add or modify poll questions and choices.

## Milestone
1. Application displays a list of active polls and allows voting on each poll.
2. The application displays the total number of "votes" for each choice in a poll. The outcomes are persistent across restarts.

## Tasks
All tasks were recorded on the [Project Board for Iteration 1](https://github.com/users/Savetang19/projects/2/views/2).

## Retrospective Summary
### What went right?
Following the tutorial. The web can function normally, and visitors can vote and view the results.
### What went wrong?
During the work, I frequently misspell words, causing the code to run incorrectly sometimes.
### What have I learned?
I have learned about the basic Django but not that much.
